Field that emulates gravity g(x)

mass adds to the "velocity" of g, dg/dt
g decays with half life lambda g (L_g)

should stabalize?



concentration of mass affects properties of it?


force(x,y
force(x,y) = sum(



================




each point is in an oscillation described by the sum of two rotating vectors

The figure traced by this sum is a Lissajous curve. We are interested in the lowest order elliptical orbits.

When the angular frequency of these vectors are equal and they rotate in opposite directions, they trace a line through the origin


The two vectors are attracted to each other
    - Produces similar effect to being attracted to a fixed angle where that angle is their mean?



When adding a nonlinearity, we can compare the pre-nonlinearity to after adding it

We could try finding what rotations of the two base vectors needs to be, keeping the magnitude and adding rotation

# spread charge to others by dist?

# nonlinear scaling of electronegativity with distance
# particle getting close to another more electronegative one causes an even more imbalanced charge
# polar covalent bond will become more polar with less distance
# potential for interaction at the scale of transferring charge from thermal motion alone
# polar covalent bond pushed closer together will cause loss of negative charge on less electronegative particle
# balancing effect pushing away? What is the attraction that makes it a balanced force?


# ---- distance not involved
# spread by bond strength minus difference in electronegativity
# should be symmetric to preserve charge


# ---- distance involved

# function of equilibrium of a bond's charge distribution given a distance and two electronegativities
# little to no difference in eneg means balanced covalent bond
# moderate difference in eneg means polar covalent bond
# large difference in eneg means ionic bond

# calculate equilibrium charge at current distance with charge difference
# charge distribution approaches that value

# track how much each electron is shared by each pair of atoms
# increased distance means amount shared with self increases
# e(n, a, b) = portion of electron n shared between a and b
# 1 = e(n, a, a) + sum_b(e(n, a, b))
# A close particle has the same pull on an electron as a farther but more eneg particle
# Normalize pull so pull(e(n), a) = 1
# Inherent pull to e(a,a)
# Pull to e(a,b) ~ eneg_a / eneg_b

Electron repels other electrons at different dropoff than protons repel protons

Multiple charges
* Each has a net charge of two different types. (A, B, ...)
* Charge oscillation
    - Induced by presence of the other field(s)?
    - A catalyzes -B -> B
    - B catalyzes A -> -A
    - -A catalyzes B -> -B
    - -B catalyzes -A -> A
    - A >B> -A
