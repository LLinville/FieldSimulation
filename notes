Field that emulates gravity g(x)

mass adds to the "velocity" of g, dg/dt
g decays with half life lambda g (L_g)

should stabalize?



concentration of mass affects properties of it?


force(x,y
force(x,y) = sum(



================




each point is in an oscillation described by the sum of two rotating vectors

The figure traced by this sum is a Lissajous curve. We are interested in the lowest order elliptical orbits.

When the angular frequency of these vectors are equal and they rotate in opposite directions, they trace a line through the origin


The two vectors are attracted to each other
    - Produces similar effect to being attracted to a fixed angle where that angle is their mean?



When adding a nonlinearity, we can compare the pre-nonlinearity to after adding it

We could try finding what rotations of the two base vectors needs to be, keeping the magnitude and adding rotation
