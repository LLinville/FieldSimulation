Combine spherical pendulum with a nonlinear particle like system, or other oscillating particle like system
kick the pendulum based on the particle oscillation
particles will have a stabalized orbit when timed in quanta of unit kick frequency. The kick lines up.
a particle with two units of spin can interact with a partcle of no spin and make two unit spins (maybe no zero-spin? then again, it could be a useful state. Maybe that's when it doesn't make full revolutions? I don't think that's possible to not have revolution)


========
Field that emulates gravity g(x)

mass adds to the "velocity" of g, dg/dt
g decays with half life lambda g (L_g)

should stabalize?



concentration of mass affects properties of it?


force(x,y
force(x,y) = sum(



================




each point is in an oscillation described by the sum of two rotating vectors

The figure traced by this sum is a Lissajous curve. We are interested in the lowest order elliptical orbits.

When the angular frequency of these vectors are equal and they rotate in opposite directions, they trace a line through the origin


The two vectors are attracted to each other
    - Produces similar effect to being attracted to a fixed angle where that angle is their mean?



When adding a nonlinearity, we can compare the pre-nonlinearity to after adding it

We could try finding what rotations of the two base vectors needs to be, keeping the magnitude and adding rotation

# spread charge to others by dist?

# nonlinear scaling of electronegativity with distance
# particle getting close to another more electronegative one causes an even more imbalanced charge
# polar covalent bond will become more polar with less distance
# potential for interaction at the scale of transferring charge from thermal motion alone
# polar covalent bond pushed closer together will cause loss of negative charge on less electronegative particle
# balancing effect pushing away? What is the attraction that makes it a balanced force?


# ---- distance not involved
# spread by bond strength minus difference in electronegativity
# should be symmetric to preserve charge


# ---- distance involved

# function of equilibrium of a bond's charge distribution given a distance and two electronegativities
# little to no difference in eneg means balanced covalent bond
# moderate difference in eneg means polar covalent bond
# large difference in eneg means ionic bond

# calculate equilibrium charge at current distance with charge difference
# charge distribution approaches that value

# track how much each electron is shared by each pair of atoms
# increased distance means amount shared with self increases
# e(n, a, b) = portion of electron n shared between a and b
# 1 = e(n, a, a) + sum_b(e(n, a, b))
# A close particle has the same pull on an electron as a farther but more eneg particle
# Normalize pull so pull(e(n), a) = 1
# Inherent pull to e(a,a)
# Pull to e(a,b) ~ eneg_a / eneg_b

Electron repels other electrons at different dropoff than protons repel protons

------
Multiple charges
* Each has a net charge of two different types. (A, B, ...)
* Charge oscillation
    - Induced by presence of the other field(s)?
    - A catalyzes -B -> B
    - B catalyzes A -> -A
    - -A catalyzes B -> -B
    - -B catalyzes -A -> A
* Base oscillation speed determines fundamental heartbeat by which higher harmonics of behavior can form
* Coupling with next door particles can form useful combinations of tunings and potentially replicate

* Proximity of particles determines how fast the process proceeds?
* Should we preserve the amount of charge summed across all charge types?

-----
Path of lone particle through the space of possible charge combinations can act as a smoothly differentiable source of behavior
* Polar curve with changing magnitude
* Path on unit hypersphere as options for path shape

---
Particles have charges, as well as rules for how they interchange charge with neighboring particles

* Rules could be a neural network to take charge or charge gradient
* dense(ncharges * 2, ncharge)
    - distance-diminished charges from one neighbor, combined with the particle's own charges, gives its affinity for each charge type
    - charge transfers to particle with higher affinity at a rate proportional difference in affinity
        - Also diminishes with distance
* Add a cost to growing or fighting for affinity control


----
Charges are instead strategic states of the particle

=========
particles exist separate from a set of fields
particles can transmute some fields into others
particles move by gradient of fields
    - Just use charges?

Layers of differing potentials. The primary structures might be threads of active particles between two layers/membranes, mediating the flow of energy between them
Convert this intra-membrane approch to either the contents of a vessicle, or between the inner and outer membrane separating an inside vs outside


===========
2d automata
each cell has N niches. Each species fills an amount of each niche
Costs more to fill more niches
    - more benefits if done well
Pressure against multiple species in same niche
gradual transfer between niches
    - or quick transfer if well adapted?

--
Measure of speciation (for visualization?)
A single location may be made of many different species. A species is able to mate with another of its species, and not outside its species
    - Allow interspecies gene transfer at a fixed (variable by evolution?) rate
A group connected by a continuous bound of mating capability is a species
    - No matter the difference between individuals in a group?
    - Group only as large as can all mate with one another? Blend of the two?
        - Optimize for fewer 'species' counted. From random starting points, anneal to fit more individuals per point



===========
Generic niches
n-dimensional space, where each point represents the fitness of an individual in a specific niche
cost to being a generalist?
dimension could represent a particular investment (instead of each point being its own niche?)
competition per niche
compete with nearby individuals if they are different enough to be a separate species?




====
each product/chemical has an energy
level of each chemical an each point?
    - Density of each atom at each point, with local correlation?
        - Compounds are vibrations around stable places in the configuration/potential field
    - Per-atom particle simulation?
transitions between energy levels
    - each compound as an energy level?
The level of a compound can influence the reaction rate of another transition
Each location has an energy transition it is trying for
Decreases in entropy in useful quantities (stored work) should conserve overall system energy
Abstract the fuel level as separate field?
If there is fuel available, transitions can happen to increase potential/do work
Production of this energy should occur by transitioning some elements at some location
    - Distribution of energy as major goal?

Heat as a separate quantity. To preserve energy in reacting two compounds, the potential energy of the reactants plus their kinetic energy should equal the potential plus kinetic energy of the products
Max temperature for a compound?
    - Temperature increases likelihood of transitions into smaller compound constituents
Heat spreading?
    molecular kinetic interactions. Depends on material and phase
Phase is dependent on temperature

Fluidity:
Pressure
    Affects reaction rates and is directly related to temperature during changes in either
Velocity
